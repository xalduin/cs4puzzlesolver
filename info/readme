Design:
    The puzzle's job is to provide the solver with methods to retrieve neighbor
    configurations as well as a method to check if the current puzzle state
    meets the specified goal.

    Given a puzzle config and a starting state, the solver uses a breadth first
    search to find the shortest path solution to the specified goal. It doesn't
    know anything about the puzzle except for the methods given to it by the
    puzzle config. These methods include retrieving neighbor configs and
    checking for a goal state.

    The configs are each able to use a different value for a "state value"
    because they extend from a templated Config class and the solveConfig
    function is also templated. Internally, the Config classes store only
    what is necessary to determine whether the goal has been reached and
    whatever information is needed to generate neighbor configurations in
    addition to the state value that is supplied to them.

    The Solver uses these methods from Config:

        bool isGoal(const T &state) const;
        void nextConfigs(std::vector<T> &out) const;

    In this case, T refers to the variable type that is used to store the state
    of the puzzle being solved. For the clock puzzle, T is an int while for the
    water puzzle, T is of the type std::vector<int> to represent how much water
    is being held by multiple containers.

    An additional display method was added to the lightconfig.cpp class that
    differs from the other config classes in that it is able to output to a
    specified ostream instead of using cout.
